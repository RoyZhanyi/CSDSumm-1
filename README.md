Customer: AirPods are connected but don’t play audio anymore any troubleshooting tips?

Agent:    & We can certainly take a look! To begin, does this occur with all devices or just one? 

Customer &  iPad and iPhone.   

Agent :   & Alright, can you tell us what iOS version you're currently on? Also, have you tried unpairing and pairing your AirPods again? 


Customer:& iPad 11.0.3 iPhone 11.0.3 and yes I have tried unpairing and issue still persisted.

Agent :   & We'd recommend creating a backup of the data on both devices and updating to iOS 11.1. Please let us know if this helps. 

Customer & That fixed it.                                                                            

Agent:   & Great. Let us know if you have any further questions or concerns. We're happy to help.
